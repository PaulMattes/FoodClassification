Requirements
------------

Innotater has been developed under Jupyter 5.7 with a Python 3.7 kernel.
I will be pleased to look into any problems running under older versions
of each.

The minimum supported Python version is considered to be 3.3.

Open CV2 is used if available and will improve speed and reliability of
image handling, but it is not currently required.
